# Summary week 2
REFLECTION 

I struggled with understanding mlflow and how to get it working. Eventually I managed to make it work with and without the sqlite database. I fiddled a bit with the filtering in de mlflow ui and sorted my runs on a descending accuracy metric. I noticed that my highest accuracy with the random grid search i implemented was 85%. I want to test if i can get to a higher percentage by automating the hypertuning with tpe.
