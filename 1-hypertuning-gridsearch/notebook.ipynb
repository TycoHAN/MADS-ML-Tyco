    "- change the number of epochs, eg to 5 or 10. \n",

    "A note on train_steps: this is a setting that determines how often you get an update. \n",

    "\n",
    "This can actually be a bit confusion for some students, because changing the value of trainsteps 938 changes the meaning of an `epoch` slightly, because one epoch is no longer the full dataset, but simply `trainstep` batches. Setting trainsteps to 100 means you need to wait twice as long before you get feedback on the performance, as compared to trainsteps=50. You will see that settings trainsteps to 100 improves the learning, but that is simply because the model has seen twice as much examples as compared to trainsteps=50.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that it is not usefull to compare trainsteps=50 and trainsteps=100, because setting it to 100 will always be better.\n",
    "Just pick an amount that works for your hardware & patience, and adjust your number of epochs accordingly (increase epochs with lower values for trainsteps)\n",

    "# 2. Reflect\n",
    "Doing a master means you don't just start engineering a pipeline, but you need to reflect. Why do you see the results you see? What does this mean, considering the theory? Write down lessons learned and reflections, based on experimental results. This is the `science` part of `data science`.\n",

    "To keep track of this process, it is useful to keep a journal. While you could use anything to do so, a nice command line tool is [jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/en/stable/). This gives you the advantage of staying in the terminal, just type down your ideas during the process, and you can always look back at what you have done.\n",
    "Try to first formulate a hypothesis, and then design an experiment to test it. This will help you to stay focused on the goal, and not get lost in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: the report you write is NOT the same as your journal! The journal will help you to keep track of your process, and later write down a reflection on what you have done where you draw conclusion, reflecting back on the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Make a short report\n",
    "Make a short 1 a4 page report of your findings.\n",
