# Excercises

- try to improve the RNN model
- test different things. What works? What does not?
- experiment with either GRU or LSTM layers, create your own models. Have a look at `mltrainer.rnn_models` for inspiration.
- experiment with adding Conv1D layers. Think about the necessary input-output dimensions of your tensors before and after each layer.

You should be able to get above 90% accuracy with the dataset.
Create a report of 1 a4 about your experiments.
