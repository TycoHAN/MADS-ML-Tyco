While "Project Cuddlefish" was a technical success, it forces us to ask a critical question: is it ethical to use artificial intelligence to enhance a creature's natural abilities?

Does our intervention give the cuttlefish an unfair advantage, potentially leading to an ecological imbalance? This project, though whimsical, serves as a microcosm for the broader debate on AI-driven biological enhancement.
